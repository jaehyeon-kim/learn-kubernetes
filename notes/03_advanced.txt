#### service discovery
# as of kubernetes 1.3, DNS is a built-in service launched automatically using addon manager
## addons are in /etc/kubernetes/addons directory on master node
# DNS service can be used within pods to find other services running on the same cluster
# multiple containers within 1 pod don't need this service, as they can contact each other directly
## container in the same pod can connect the port of the other container directly using localhost:port
# To DNS works, a pod will need a service definition
